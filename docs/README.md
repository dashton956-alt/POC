## System Context

### Purpose
This system provides Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Intent-Based Networking capabilities through:
- Automated device type and manufacturer imports from community libraries
- NetBox integration for network infrastructure management
- Workflow-driven automation for network configuration
- Multi-vendor support with extensible architecture

### Target Audience
- **DevOps Architects**: System design and integration planning
- **Network Engineers**: Network infrastructure automation and management
- **Cloud Engineers**: Cloud-native deployment and scaling
- **Security Teams**: Security framework and compliance
- **Customers**: Business value and capability overview

### Key Features
- **Multi-Vendor Support**: Import device types from 200+ vendors
- **Real-time Processing**: Live progress updates via WebSocket
- **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive error handling with partial success
- **Scalable Architecture**: Async processing with horizontal scaling capability
- **Audit Trail**: Complete workflow execution logging and tracking

## Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- NetBox instance with API access
- Device type library (Git repository)

### Running the System
```bash
# Clone and start
git clone <repository>
cd IBN_working
docker-compose up -d

# Access UI
http://localhost:3000

# API Documentation
http://localhost:8080/docs
```

### Basic Usage
1. Access the web interface
2. Navigate to "Import Vendors" workflow
3. Select vendors or choose "Import All"
4. Monitor real-time progress
5. Review import results and logs

## Architecture Highlights

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3.11+, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Redis
- **Frontend**: React 18+, TypeScript, Material-UI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 14+ (primary), Redis 7+ (cache/queue)
- **Orchestration**: orchestrator-core 4.0.4
- **Integration**: NetBox REST API, DeviceType Library (YAML)

### Design Principles
- **Async-First**: Non-blocking operations with async/await
- **Event-Driven**: Redis pub/sub for real-time updates
- **State-Managed**: Persistent workflow state in PostgreSQL
- **Error-Resilient**: Graceful degradation with detailed logging
- **Extensible**: Plugin architecture for future integrations

### Security Features
- API authentication and authorization (future)
- TLS encryption for all communications
- Input validation and sanitization
- Audit logging for compliance
- Secure credential management

## Development Workflow

### Git Branch Structure
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `netbox-feature-workflows`: Feature development
- `documentation`: Documentation updates

### Current Status
- âœ… Multi-vendor import workflow (unlimited selection)
