### v1.0.0 Release Highlights
This initial release provides a complete Proof of Concept for Intent-Based Networking using NetBox and a custom orchestrator. The setup includes:

1. **Complete Infrastructure**: All services containerized and ready to run
2. **Rich Device Library**: 8000+ device types from major network vendors
3. **API Integration**: Full NetBox API integration with custom orchestrator
4. **Workflow Engine**: Foundation for automated network provisioning
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive setup and usage documentation
6. **Development Ready**: All tools and configurations for continued development

The POC demonstrates the potential for automated network management and provides a solid foundation for production deployment with additional hardening and optimization.
